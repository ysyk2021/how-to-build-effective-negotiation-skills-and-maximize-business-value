Virtual reality (VR) training is an emerging approach to negotiation skills training that offers a highly immersive and interactive learning experience.

By simulating realistic negotiation scenarios, VR training enables negotiators to practice their skills in a safe and controlled environment, allowing them to experiment with different approaches and strategies without fear of negative consequences.

Gamification

Artificial intelligence (AI) is another technology that is being increasingly used in negotiation skills training. AI-powered tools can analyze negotiation data and provide insights into negotiation patterns and strategies, helping learners to identify areas for improvement and refine their skills.

In addition, AI-powered simulations can provide a realistic and dynamic learning experience, allowing learners to practice their negotiation skills in a variety of contexts and scenarios.
